# Dhash

Dhash's (or difference hashes) are a way of calculating similarity between images. If two images have a similar dhash, then the likelihood is that they both are depicting the same image (albeit slightly cropped compressed etc).

```

## Usage
```ruby
hash1 = Dhash.calculate('face-high.jpg')
hash2 = Dhash.calculate('face-low.jpg')

if Dhash.hamming(hash1, hash2) < 10
  puts "Images are very similar"
else
  puts "No match"
end
```
